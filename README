ArboMAP (Arbovirus Modeling and Prediction to Forecast Mosquito-Borne Disease Outbreaks) is a set
of software to be used in the RStudio envionment, to model and predict vector-borne diseases, esp-
ecially arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes.

The "ArboMAP User's Guide.pdf" file contains information on installation and use of ArboMAP, and
most users should begin by reading through the file completely. 

The Rmd files contain code for the program. The GRIDMET.js downloader file contains Javascript to
download weather data from Google Earth Engine. The ArboMAP.Rproj file will open in RStudio, allo-
wing the program to find all the necessary data. The various directories contain either example data
or example outputs from the program.

Note: the human and mosquito data that come packaged with ArboMAP are synthetic data, created by
first fitting the model on West Nile virus in South Dakota, and then generating human cases and
mosquito pools according to that model. Hence, while they are consistent with the overall trends
of actual data, they are not actual data, and must not be used in any scientific endeavor. Rather,
they exist so that the user can see an example of the code working well with validated data.
