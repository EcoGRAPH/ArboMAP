1. Update human data: At the beginning of a new season, i.e. a new forecast year, the previous year's human case data will need to be added to the single CSV file, in the `data_human` folder, with these required fields:
    * County identification field: Either the county FIPS code (`r fields_fips`) or the county name (`r fields_names`), as matched to what is used in mosquito data. 
    * `date`: the onset date of the symptoms of the case ("MM/DD/YYYY" or in non-ambiguous formats such as YYYY-MM-DD) 


2. Update off-season weather data via GEE app: 
    1. Go to <https://dawneko.users.earthengine.app/view/arbomap-gridmet>.
    2. Pick your state, and edit the start date to a week or so before the last updated previous data. 
    3. Click the download link in the popup window on the map. Save or move the file to the `data_weather` folder.  

    ```{r app, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%', fig.cap="ArboMAP Google Earth Engine app to download gridMET weather data."}
    knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "gee_app_trim.jpg"))
    ```


3. Annual parameter updates: The defaults can be updated by manually editing the header of the `ArboMAP_forecast.Rmd` file, or the correct setting or file can be picked from the interactive user interface each time. 
    1. `year_mosquito_end`: Update to the current forecast year. 
    2. `year_weather_end`: Update to the current forecast year. 
    3. If the file names of the human (or mosquito) data have changed, those parameters will also need to be updated. 


4. Optional annual TeX Live update - if creating pdf reports (not needed for html reports), then TeX Live, which released beginning of April every year, will need to be updated:
    1. Click on the `ArboMAP.Rproj` file to open the project in RStudio.
    2. In RStudio, in the Files pane, click on `annual_midApril_tex_update.R`. 
    3. In the Source pane that opens up, make sure the cursor is at the start of line 1, and hit "Run". 

```{r annual-tex, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%', fig.cap="Annual TeX update script as seen in RStudio Source pane."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "annual_tex.jpg"))
```
